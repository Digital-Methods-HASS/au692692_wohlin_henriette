```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Setup


Setting up library:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(RColorBrewer)
```


Making data frame:
```{r}
aircrafts_ww2 <- read.csv("data/world_war_2_aircrafts.csv")
```

## Cleaning data 

Changing column names:
```{r}
colnames(aircrafts_ww2)[1] = "Aircraft_type"
colnames(aircrafts_ww2)[2] = "Aircraft_subtype"
colnames(aircrafts_ww2)[3] = "Aircraft_name"
colnames(aircrafts_ww2)[4] = "Year_service"
colnames(aircrafts_ww2)[5] = "Country"
```

Problem: n/a, blank and 1 1930s in Year_service column. We need to fix that in order to change Year_ service column to a numeric one.

Removing n/a:
```{r}
aircrafts_ww2$Year_service <- str_replace(aircrafts_ww2$Year_service, "s", "") 
```
Source: https://sparkbyexamples.com/r-programming/r-str_replace-to-replace-matched-patterns-in-a-string/ 

Removing s:
```{r}
aircrafts_ww2$Year_service <- str_replace(aircrafts_ww2$Year_service, "n/a", "")
```

Replacing blank with NA:
```{r}
aircrafts_ww2[aircrafts_ww2 == ""] <- NA
```

Another problem I found in the data set was that there was a single aircraft that had Germany and Japan listed as their country of origin. I chose to change this to Japan. 
```{r}
aircrafts_ww2$Country <- str_replace(aircrafts_ww2$Country, "Germany, Japan", "Japan")
```


Now I can change the Year_service column to a numeric one:
```{r}
aircrafts_ww2$Year_service <- as.numeric(as.character(aircrafts_ww2$Year_service))
```

"Strategic and photo-reconnaissance aircraft" is a long name so I am changing it to "Strat. and Photo-recon. aircraft":
```{r}
aircrafts_ww2$Aircraft_type <- gsub("Strategic and Photo-reconnaissance aircraft", "Strat. and Photo-recon. aircraft", aircrafts_ww2$Aircraft_type)
```

## 1. All aircrafts  


First I would like to make a visualization of every aircraft in the data set to find out which has the highest count. 

```{r}
aircrafts_ww2 %>%
  select(Aircraft_type) %>% 
  count(Aircraft_type, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(Aircraft_type = fct_reorder(Aircraft_type, n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = Aircraft_type, fill=Aircraft_type)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Paired") +
  geom_col() + 
  theme_light() +
  labs(title = "Total number of Aircrafts", 
       y = "Aircraft type",
       x = "Number of aircrafts") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,300,20)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
```


Source for fct_reorder code: https://r-graph-gallery.com/267-reorder-a-variable-in-ggplot2.html

From this we can see that prototypes have the highest number is quite ahead over the others. Bomber and Attack aircrafts is the second highest with Transport and Utility close by. 



## 2. All aircrafts and Country of origin

Now I would like to look at which country produced the most aircrafts. 


First we can try for every aircraft:
```{r}
aircrafts_ww2 %>%
  drop_na(Country) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_rev(fct_infreq(Country)))) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = Aircraft_type)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Paired") +
  theme_light() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Aircraft type by Country of origin",
       y = "Number of aircrafts",
       x = "Country") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,300,20)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
```


From this we can see that the US has the most types of aircraft followed by UK, then Germany, Japan, France, Italy, USSR and so on.


I would like to compare the biggest participants of aircrafts in World War 2, so I will sort it even more: 

```{r}
aircrafts_ww2 %>%
  filter(Country %in% c ("US", "UK", "Germany", "Japan", "France", "USSR", "Italy")) %>% 
  drop_na(Country) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_rev(fct_infreq(Country)))) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = Aircraft_type)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Paired") +
  theme_light() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Aircraft type by Country of origin",
       y = "Number of aircrafts",
       x = "Country") +
    scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,300,10)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
```


## 3. All Aircrafts and Year in service 

This time I would like to examine the different types of aircrafts and the year that they entered service which means the year the aircraft had its first flight. 



Now let us try to visualize it as we have done before with every aircraft: 
```{r}
aircrafts_ww2 %>%
  drop_na(Year_service) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Year_service)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = Aircraft_type)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Paired") +
  theme_light() +
  labs(title = "Aircraft types and Year of service",
       y = "Number of aircrafts",
       x = "Entered service (Year)") +
    scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,120,5)) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1913,1945,1)) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8))
```


I would like to try and compare the interwar period and World War 2 to see if there is a difference. 

Interwar period (1919-1939):
```{r}
aircrafts_ww2 %>%
  drop_na(Year_service) %>% 
  filter(Year_service %in% c("1919","1920", "1921", "1922", "1923", "1924", "1925", "1926", "1926", "1927", "1928", "1929", "1930","1931","1932","1933", "1934","1935", "1936", "1937","1938")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Year_service)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = Aircraft_type)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Paired") + 
  theme_light() +
  labs(title = "Number of Aircrafts and Year of service (1919-1938)",
       y = "Number of aircrafts",
       x = "Entered service (Year)") +
    scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,120,5)) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1919,1938,1)) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
```

World War 2 (1939-1945):
```{r}
aircrafts_ww2 %>%
  drop_na(Year_service) %>% 
  filter(Year_service %in% c("1939", "1940", "1941", "1942", "1943", "1944", "1945")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Year_service)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = Aircraft_type)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Paired") +
  theme_light() +
  labs(title = "Number of Aircrafts and Year of service (1939-1945)",
       y = "Number of aircrafts",
       x = "Entered service (Year)") +
    scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,120,5)) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1939,1945,1)) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10))
```


If we compare these two graphs it does show that there was an increase in the number of aircrafts being produced during the second war. More aircrafts being produced while war is being fought  also makes sense as many aircrafts get destroyed during war â€“ aircrafts were always evolving to be better than the last and aircrafts from before 1938 might not have cut it anymore. 

Production of new aircrafts seems to slow down at 1943-1944. At 1945 production falls drasti-cally which was most likely as the war was near its end. 


## 4. All Aircrafts and Year in service by specific Country of Origin 

Now I would to visualize the biggest participants of aircrafts in World War 2 by their Year of service and what types of Aircrafts they made: 

USA: 
```{r}
aircrafts_ww2 %>%
  filter(Country %in% c ("US")) %>%

  geom_bar(aes(fill = Aircraft_type)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Paired") +
  theme_light() +
  labs(title = "Aircraft types and Year of service (USA)",
       y = "Number of aircrafts",
       x = "Entered service (Year)") +
    scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,40,1)) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1913,1945,1)) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
